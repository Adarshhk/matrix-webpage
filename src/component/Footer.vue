                    Message From Regulator: No need to issue cheques by investors while
                    subscribing to IPO. Just write the bank account number and sign in the
                    application form to authorise your bank to make payment in case of
                    allotment. No worries for refund as the money remains in investor's
                    account. 1) Message from Exchange(s): Prevent Unauthorised
                    transactions in your account --> Update your mobile numbers/email IDs
                    with your stock brokers. Receive information of your transactions
                    directly from Exchange on your mobile/email at the end of the day.
                    Issued in the interest of investors. 2) Message from Depositories: a)
                    Prevent Unauthorized Transactions in your demat account --> Update
                    your mobile number with your Depository Participant. Receive alerts on
                    your registered mobile for all debit and other important transactions
                    in your demat account directly from NSDL on the same day issued in the
                    interest of investors. b) KYC is one time exercise while dealing in
                    securities markets - once KYC is done through a SEBI registered
                    intermediary (broker, DP, Mutual Fund etc.), you need not undergo the
                    same process again when you approach another intermediary. Company
