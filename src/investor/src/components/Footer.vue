                Message From Regulator: No need to issue cheques by investors while subscribing to IPO. Just write the
                bank account number and sign in the application form to authorise your bank to make payment in case of
                allotment. No worries for refund as the money remains in investor's account. 1) Message from
                Exchange(s): Prevent Unauthorised transactions in your account --> Update your mobile numbers/email IDs
                with your stock brokers. Receive information of your transactions directly from Exchange on your
                mobile/email at the end of the day. Issued in the interest of investors. 2) Message from Depositories:
                a) Prevent Unauthorized Transactions in your demat account --> Update your mobile number with your
                Depository Participant. Receive alerts on your registered mobile for all debit and other important
                transactions in your demat account directly from NSDL on the same day issued in the interest of
                investors. b) KYC is one time exercise while dealing in securities markets - once KYC is done through a
                SEBI registered intermediary (broker, DP, Mutual Fund etc.), you need not undergo the same process again
                when you approach another intermediary.
